# Minecart Chaining Exploration Guide

## What You Have Now

Your Fabric mod now has some exploration tools to help you understand how minecarts work:

### 1. Minecart Debug Info
- Right-click any minecart in-game
- You'll see position, velocity, UUID, type, and passenger info
- This helps you understand what data minecarts have

### 2. Chain Item 
- Use `/give @s betterminecarts:chain` to get a chain item
- Right-click with it to find nearby minecarts
- It shows detailed minecart information

### 3. MinecartExplorer Class
- Contains helper methods for linking minecarts
- Shows how to store data in entity NBT
- Demonstrates basic minecart relationships

## How to Experiment

1. **Start a test world** and place some minecarts on rails
2. **Right-click minecarts** to see their debug info
3. **Get a chain item** with `/give @s betterminecarts:chain`
4. **Try the chain item** near minecarts to see what data they contain

## Key Concepts You're Learning

### Entity System
- Minecarts are entities that exist in the world
- They have UUIDs (unique identifiers) that persist across saves
- They store data in NBT (Named Binary Tags)

### Data Storage
- **Entity NBT**: Permanent data stored with the minecart
- **Item NBT**: Temporary data you could store in the chain item
- **World Data**: Global data storage (for complex linking systems)

### Events and Interactions
- `UseEntityCallback`: Triggered when players interact with entities
- `ItemUsageContext`: For item interactions with the world
- Server vs Client: Logic runs on server, visuals on client

## Next Steps to Explore

### A. Study Minecart Movement
Look at how minecarts move and update. The key method is in `AbstractMinecartEntity.tick()`.

### B. Experiment with NBT Data
Try storing custom data in minecarts using the `MinecartExplorer.linkMinecarts()` method.

### C. Distance and Physics
Think about how chains would work:
- How far apart can linked carts be?
- What happens when one cart moves?
- How do you apply forces between carts?

### D. Visual Rendering
For the actual chain visual:
- You'll need client-side rendering
- Look at how leads/leashes are rendered
- Consider particle effects for chain links

## File Structure Explanation

```
src/main/java/io/github/maahibatra/betterminecarts/
├── Betterminecarts.java          # Main mod class, registers items and events
├── MinecartExplorer.java         # Helper methods for understanding/linking carts
└── items/
    └── ChainItem.java           # Custom item for minecart interaction
```

## Understanding the Code

### Event Registration
```java
UseEntityCallback.EVENT.register((player, world, hand, entity, hitResult) -> {
    // This runs when you right-click an entity
});
```

### Entity Data Access
```java
if (entity instanceof AbstractMinecartEntity minecart) {
    // Now you can access minecart-specific methods
    minecart.getPos();      // Position
    minecart.getVelocity(); // Movement
    minecart.getUuid();     // Unique ID
}
```

### NBT Data Storage
```java
NbtCompound nbt = new NbtCompound();
minecart.writeNbt(nbt);           // Get current data
nbt.putUuid("linked_cart", otherCartUuid);  // Add your data
minecart.readNbt(nbt);            // Save it back
```

## What You Could Try Next

1. **Modify the ChainItem** to actually store a minecart UUID on first click, then link on second click
2. **Create a simple force system** where linked carts pull each other
3. **Add visual feedback** when carts are linked
4. **Experiment with mixins** to modify minecart tick behavior
5. **Study existing mods** like the Cammie's Minecart Tweaks we found

## Important Fabric Concepts

- **Mixins**: Modify existing Minecraft code without replacing it
- **Events**: Hook into game actions (player interactions, entity updates, etc.)
- **Registries**: Register your custom items, blocks, entities
- **Client vs Server**: Logic separation for multiplayer compatibility

Remember: You're not trying to build the complete feature yet. You're exploring and understanding the systems you'll need to work with!
