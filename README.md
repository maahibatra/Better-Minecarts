# Better Minecarts

This minecraft mod links up minecarts to form a train-like system!
THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND KINDA BROKEN IN SOME WAYS!!

## How To Use

- Place down two minecarts (any type) one block apart from each other on rail blocks (any type).
- Take a chain in your hand and right click on both minecarts.
- Repeat the process for a longer train by connecting all minecarts to the ones in front of or behind them.
- You can now move them using powered rails or furnace carts!

## To-Do

- [x] Basic linked sync movement
- [x] Fix corner derailing
- [ ] Fix unlikability of more than two minecarts
- [ ] Fix issue of being able to sit in furnace/chest/etc minecarts
- [ ] Fix issue of being unable to use furnace/chest/etc minecarts
