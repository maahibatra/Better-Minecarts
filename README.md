# Better Minecarts

This minecraft mod links up minecarts to form a train-like system! You can link up to 8 minecarts in one train.

THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND KINDA BROKEN IN SOME WAYS!! It is still a bit wonky when minecarts are pushed by player and go around a corner slowly :( Other than that should work on corners!

## How To Use

- Place down two minecarts (any type) one block apart from each other on rail blocks (any type).
- Take a chain in your hand and right click on both minecarts.
- Repeat the process for a longer train by connecting all minecarts to the ones in front of or behind them.
- They will now move together!
- If you wish to unlink a minecart, shift and attack the minecart once, giving you a chain and unlinking it. Alternatively, breaking (no shifting required) a linked minecart will also drop a chain and unlink it.
